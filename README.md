# HeartBeatz

My thoughts in general: I'm not super used to python, and I assume you guys are more comfortable so please rewrite/delete/reorganize anything in here that wouldn't make sense. But it seems best to me if we develop main.py together as kinda the central function of the program, and then delegate the individual tasks (like connecting to bluetooth, erg data, apple watch, etc.) in their own files, and then just pull what we need into main.py. 


side note: since we have 2 prototypes, it may be eaasier for our first one if we don't worry about the stretch range for a song, so we just play each song to completion, even if it is drastically changed

side note 2: I don't think we need a front end, we could probably get by just using terminal stdin/stdout for inputs and tracking data, maybe we add a simple interface in the second prototype
